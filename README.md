# Moving beyond `theme_gray()`

Presentation for the Coding group meeting, held at NTNU on October 6th 2021.

The presentation shows the basic steps of creating your own theme in `ggplot2`, and illustrates this on a data set. I also provide two cheatsheets, one for [identifying the different theme elements](https://github.com/emmaSkarstein/Coding-group-presentation/blob/master/Anatomy-ggplot.pdf), and another that [summarizes the presentation and gives some useful resources](https://github.com/emmaSkarstein/Coding-group-presentation/blob/master/Cheatsheet_emma.pdf).
